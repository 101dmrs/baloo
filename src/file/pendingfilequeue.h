 * The active file queue maintains a queue of file paths
 * with a timestamp.

 * When a file enters the queue, it will immediately time out.
 * If the file has just timed out (default is upto 5 seconds), then it will
 * time out after a given time. As soon as a file is queued again its timestamp
 * will be reset and the timing restarts.
 *
 * This allows to "compress" file modification events of downloads
 * and the like into a single event resulting in a smoother
 * experience for the user.
 *
 * Whereas modification events which occur only one will immediately
 * be sent forward.
